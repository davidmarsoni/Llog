# Llog

![alt text](assets/cover.png)

Llog is an HES-SO school project that leverages [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index) on notes taken in [Notion](https://www.notion.com) during previous academic semesters.

The goal is to provide a simple and accurate way to search for notes in Notion, using the LlamaIndex framework.

## Full Documentation

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/davidmarsoni/Llog/wiki) for full documentation, examples, operational details and other information.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration
